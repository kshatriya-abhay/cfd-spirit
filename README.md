#Overview
The project is made for the convenienceof our hostelmates and the shopkeepers. This project includes a portal through which 
shopkeepers can login/register into the webpage. In there portal they are given freedom to enter the data related to items that
they have in their shops like item_type, item_price etc. They can edit previous product, insert new items based on their convenience.
They other part of the project is the user. Users can see all the items that are available in the hostel in various shops along
with their availability and the price details.
