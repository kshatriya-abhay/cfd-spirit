#Overview
The project is made for the convenience of our hostelmates and the shopkeepers. This project includes a portal through which 
shopkeepers can login/register into the webpage. In there portal they are given freedom to enter the data related to items that they have in their shops like item_type, item_cost etc. They can edit previous product, insert new items based on their convenience.
The other part of the project is the user. Users can see all the items that are available in the hostel in various shops along
with their availability and the price details.

#Features Added
Authentication: A shopkeeper that has logged-in can access any page, while a normal hostel user can only visit the pages allowed to public (Exclusions). If he tries to visit a url that he is not permitted to enter, he will be given an HTTP 404 error.
Search: when viewing all items, a user/shopkeeper can use the search bar to search for a specific item by its name.
